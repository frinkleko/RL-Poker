## Analysis and design

For the Texas game, we need to have classes of environment like table, deck, card. We also need to have classes of player and computer. After all, a checker class/function to decide who is winner is also needed. For GUI recourses, it is also a great idea to manage with class. So the project can be divided and designed as the following parts.
